# ARIMA and seasonal ARIMA
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, or ARIMA, is one of the most widely used forecasting methods for univariate time series data forecasting.
<br/>
Although the method can handle data with a trend, it does not support time series with a seasonal component.
<br/>
An extension to ARIMA that supports the direct modeling of the seasonal component of the series is called SARIMA.
<br/>
In the ipynb file the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, or SARIMA, method for time series forecasting with univariate data containing trends and seasonality 
is implented.
<br.>
* The main things covered are:
     * The limitations of ARIMA when it comes to seasonal data.
     * The SARIMA extension of ARIMA that explicitly models the seasonal element in univariate data.
     * How to implement the SARIMA method in Python using the Statsmodels library.
